        <li>1/2 pound bacon</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Butter an 8 x 8 inch baking pan. Grate the potatoes on the large holes of
            a box grater,<br>and place grated potatoes in a bowl of cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook bacon over medium high heat until bacon is crisp and fat is rendered, about 7 minutes.
            Remove bacon and<br>drain on paper towels. Once bacon is cool enough to handle, coarsely chop.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of bacon fat, return pan to medium heat, and add chopped onion. 
            Cook until onions<br>are soft and brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and reserve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine beaten eggs and milk and season with salt and pepper. Remove a handful of grated potatoes
            from water<br>and place in center of clean dishtowel. Close towel around potato and twist towel to
            ring out water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add drained potatoes to egg/milk mixture and repeat with remaining potatoes. Add chopped bacon and
            onions to<br>potato mixture and, using a wooden spoon, mix until all ingredients are well combined; then
            pour into prepared baking pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place in preheated oven and bake until potatoes are soft and brown and beginning to crisp, about 1
            hour.<br>Serve with sour cream and sliced scallions.
        </li>
    </ol>
