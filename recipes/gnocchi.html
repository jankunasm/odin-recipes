    <h2 class="gn-ingr">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="gn-ingr-content">
        <li>2 pounds baking potatoes (about 4)</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>Pink Himalayan salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="gn-inst">Instructions</h2>

    <ol class="gn-inst-content">
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Place potatoes directly on middle rack in preheated oven. Bake until very
            tender when pierced<br>with a knife. A bit over 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Carefully cut potatoes in half lengthwise; let stand until cool enough to handle. Use a paring knife
            to peel potatoes<br>and discard the skins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Thoroughly mash potatoes in a bowl and place on a clean work surface; spread in an even layer.<br>
            Let cool until almost room temp, Drizzle egg yolk evenly over potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle salt and 1/2 cup of the flour evenly over potatoes and egg yolk. Using a bench scraper
            or rubber spatula,<br>very gently fold mixture over onto itself several times. Gradually fold remaining
            1/2 cup of flour until dough is<br>incorporated and dough comes together in mass.
        </li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and dust lightly with flour. Divide dough evenly in 4 pieces,<br>
            Roll 1 dough piece into 3/4 inch thick rope. Cut rope crosswise, roll each piece against tines of a
            fork to make ridges;<br>transfer to baking sheet and repeat process with all dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring salted water to a boil in a 4-quart stockpot over high. Cook until gnocchi rise to surface, about
            2 minutes,<br>and then gently boil 1 more minute, reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in large skillet. Transfer cooked gnocchi to skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
            Cook about 1 minute until a creamy and loose butter sauce forms and coats gnocchi. Season with salt
            and pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
